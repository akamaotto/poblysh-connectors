# Bun configuration for Next.js demo tests
# This config ensures:
# - React Testing Library runs with a DOM-like environment
# - @testing-library/jest-dom matchers are available globally
# - Minimal, explicit setup for Bun's test runner

[default]
# You can set global test options under the [test] table below.

[test]
# Use a Node-like environment; our setup file will polyfill DOM globals via jsdom.
# (Bun currently doesn't expose a "jsdom" environment flag like Jest;
# we wire jsdom ourselves in testSetup.ts.)
root = "./"
preload = ["./testSetup.ts"]
