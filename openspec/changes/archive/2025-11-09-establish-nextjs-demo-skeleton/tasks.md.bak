## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Must have existing `examples/nextjs-demo` Next.js project
- Requires `plan/nextjs-demo/` documents to be complete and approved
- Related OpenSpec changes should be reviewed for consistency
- Design system (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) should be properly configured

## Validation Criteria

Each task should be considered complete when:
- Implementation matches requirements in corresponding spec
- Code follows project conventions and patterns
- Educational annotations are clear and accurate
- Component is tested manually for basic functionality
- No console errors or warnings in development mode

## Parallel Work Opportunities

- Tasks 2-4 (domain layer) can be worked in parallel
- Tasks 6-7 (UI pages) can be developed simultaneously
- Tasks 11-13 (signal pages) can be parallelized
- Documentation tasks (16, 19) can overlap with development

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (Core UI)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (Integrations)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (Signals)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days (Grounding)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 days (Polish)
- **Phase 7**: 1-2 days (Validation)

**Total estimated effort**: 11-18 days depending on parallelization and experience level.
